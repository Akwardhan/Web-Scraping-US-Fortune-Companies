# Web Scraping & Data Structuring: U.S. Fortune Companies

## Overview  
This project demonstrates a simple but effective web scraping and data transformation process using Python. Real-world financial data was extracted from Wikipedia, cleaned, and structured into a CSV file that is ready for further analysis or visualization.

## Tools

## Output Preview  
📁 [`us_fortune_companies.csv`](./us_fortune_companies.csv) – Final cleaned dataset

## Source Code  
📄 [`scrape_us_fortune_companies.py`](./scrape_us_fortune_companies.py) – Python script used for scraping and data processing

## Learnings
