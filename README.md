# Web Scraping & Data Structuring: U.S. Fortune Companies

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of Python to scrape real-world company data from Wikipedia and structure it into a clean, analysis-ready format. The data includes the largest U.S. companies by revenue and was processed using BeautifulSoup and pandas for further analysis or visualization.

## Tools  
- Python  
- BeautifulSoup  
- Requests  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Source  
Data was extracted from:  
[List of largest companies in the United States by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue)

## Objectives  
- Scrape tabular financial data from a live website  
- Convert raw HTML into structured tabular form using pandas  
- Export the cleaned dataset into CSV and Excel formats  
- Showcase clean, reproducible data collection in a Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset Includes  
- Company Name  
- Industry  
- Revenue  
- Headquarters Location  
- Number of Employees  

## Data Snapshot
Below is a sample view showing the top 5 companies from the dataset after scraping and structuring:
